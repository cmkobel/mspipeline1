    - lxml # I successfully ran pip install lxml in the non-extra env.
    #- easypqp # First I installed the nightly pyopenms (dependency of easypqp), but then when I try to install easypqp nightly, it doesn't like python 3.11, so maybe I should try using python 3.10 instead. Or maybe 3.9 https://github.com/grosenberger/easypqp/issues/85#issuecomment-1280535721
